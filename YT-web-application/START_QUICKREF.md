# Quick Reference: Enhanced start.sh

## What's New? 🎉

The `start.sh` script has been upgraded with automatic browser launching and smart shutdown handling!

## Quick Start

```bash
bash start.sh
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Checks your setup
2. 🚀 Starts the server
3. ⏳ Waits for server to be ready
4. 🌐 **Opens browser automatically!**
5. ✨ Shows you the running info

## Example Output

```
🎬 Starting YouTube Downloader...
🚀 Starting Flask application on http://localhost:5000
📝 Press Ctrl+C to stop the server

⏳ Waiting for server to start...
✓ Server is ready!
🌐 Opening browser...

✓ Application is running!
  URL: http://localhost:5000
  PID: 12345

Press Ctrl+C to stop...
```

## Stopping the Server

### Method 1: Press Ctrl+C
```
Just press Ctrl+C in the terminal
```

Output:
```
^C
🛑 Shutting down YouTube Downloader...
✓ Server stopped successfully
```

### Method 2: Close the Terminal
```
Simply close the terminal window
```
The server will automatically stop!

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🌐 **Auto Browser** | Opens your default browser automatically |
| ⏳ **Smart Wait** | Waits for server to be ready before opening browser |
| 🛑 **Clean Stop** | Ctrl+C properly stops everything |
| 📊 **Process Info** | Shows URL and PID when running |
| 🔒 **Safe Cleanup** | No orphaned processes left behind |

## Browser Support

The script automatically detects your OS and opens the browser:

- 🐧 **Linux**: xdg-open or gnome-open
- 🍎 **macOS**: open command
- 🪟 **Windows**: start command (Git Bash)

If it can't detect your browser, it shows you the URL to open manually.

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Doesn't Open?

**No problem!** Just open manually:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Server Won't Stop?

Try force-stopping:
```bash
pkill -f "python.*run.py"
```

### Port Already in Use?

Kill what's using it:
```bash
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
```

## Command Line Tips

```bash
# Normal start (browser opens automatically)
bash start.sh

# View the script (to see what it does)
cat start.sh

# Check if server is running
ps aux | grep run.py

# Manually kill server
kill <PID>  # Use the PID shown when starting
```

## What Gets Cleaned Up?

When you press Ctrl+C or close the terminal:

✅ Flask server process is stopped  
✅ Any remaining Python processes are killed  
✅ Resources are freed  
✅ Port 5000 is released  
✅ Clean exit with confirmation message  

## Pro Tips

💡 **Tip 1**: The browser opens after server is ready (no more "server not ready" errors!)

💡 **Tip 2**: You can close the browser and the server keeps running

💡 **Tip 3**: Press Ctrl+C once for clean shutdown (no need to spam it!)

💡 **Tip 4**: The script tracks the PID, so it only kills its own server

💡 **Tip 5**: If something goes wrong, just run `bash start.sh` again
